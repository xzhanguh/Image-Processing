Develop a Matlab function that filters the given input image with Adaptive Median Filtering algorithm discussed in the class. Following are the specific requirements:

• Your function will take two parameters:
  o Name of the input image (assume the image is in the same folder as your Matlab function)
  o A scalar value for Smax

• Your output must show the following (using sub-plots): 
  o Original image
  o Output (filtered) image
