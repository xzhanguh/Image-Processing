Develop a Matlab function that implements the Otsu’s optimum thresholding algorithm. Your function must:
• Implement the full algorithm discussed in the class lecture.
• Your function must accept one parameter:
  o name of the input image (which is in the same folder as your Matlab function)
• Your function must show the following in the output in one figure using subplot function and appropriate titles:
  o input image
  o histogram of input image along with the threshold value (determined by Otsu’s Thresholding algorithm) marked on it with a different color o Otsu’s thresholded image
